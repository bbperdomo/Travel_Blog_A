//So what is a thread?

/*"A thread, in the context of Java, is the path followed when executing a program. All Java programs have at least one thread,
known as the main thread, which is created by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) at the programâ€™s start,
when the main() method is invoked with the main thread." */

//Whats a thread pool?

/* It is a group of fixed sized threads. A thread from the thread pool is pulled out and assigned a job by the service provider.
 After completion of the job, the thread is contained in the thread pool again. */

//The BlogHttpClient class is defined as "final" and its constructor is declared as "private"
//because there should only be 1 instance of the BlogHttpClient class across the ENTIRE application
//This is basically to save memory usage, as creating a thread for every new client/request is too resource intensive
//hover over httpclient for more info
